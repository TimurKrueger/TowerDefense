<!-- 
Campaign Level Definers: (For Syntax see the test level aka Level 0; Keep in mind to NOT change the order of the arguments or you might break something!) 
ID: Level ID by which it is selected in the LevelManager. MUST BE UNIQUE FROM OTHER LEVEL IDS!!!
WaveCount: How many Waves will the level have?
Procedural: If set to true non-defined Waves will be generated automatically from the last Wave and the Growth Factor.
            If set to false ALL Waves MUST be set manually or the LevelManager will throw an exception!
            The first Wave of a Level MUST be defined and non-procedural!
GrowthFactor: Only used (and required) if Procedural is set to true. Multiplier for the EnemyCounts of the last wave
Waves: Contains all defined Waves of the current Level
Wave: 
      Each Wave has its own ID which determines when it will be occur. MUST BE UNIQUE WITHIN A LEVEL!!!
      Enemies defines all enemies for the current Wave. Each Enemy Entry is defined by ID (dependent on GameMaster Enemy ID; should but doesn't need to be unique) and its Count.
